# SUPERCHESS
Chess has long stood as a benchmark of logic, strategy, and computational thinking, but most digital implementations remain limited to rigid adherence to tournament rules. While
this preserves the integrity of the game, it can also feel repetitive or unwelcoming for casual players who desire creativity, variability, or a lighter gaming experience.
SuperChess was created to address this gap. It is a Python-based chess application that includes two distinct modes:
1. Normal Mode – A faithful implementation of traditional chess, with all rules applied correctly.
2. Super Mode – An innovative variant where each chess piece is equipped with unique superpowers that can be activated through an energy charge system. By combining the familiar mechanics of chess with novel gameplay features, SuperChess provides a balanced experience for both classic players and those seeking fun and experimentation.


## **SUPER MODE RULES**
- Players can hold maximum of 3 superpower charges.
- The charges are obtained by taking the opponent pieces without superpower (normal taking method).
- Each turn only counts with one charge and a power used would be considered a move.
- Every character possesses a particular superpower that can be used only when there are charges.

  The superpower for each piece is described in the following table:
  | Piece |	Superpower |
  |-------|------------|
  | King	Royal Teleport | Exchange position with any of his ally piece unless this action results in a check/ checkmate. |
  | Queen	Dark Empress | Able to move like a knight for one turn (L shaped movement). |
  | Rook	Fortress Field | The rook makes an area 3 squares x 3 squares, which no enemies can enter for one turn. |
  | Bishop	Phase Shift | Able to move through friendly pieces for one turn. |
  | Knight 	Shadow jump | Able to move to any square within 3x3 area. |
  | Pawn	Sacrifice | Destroys itself and takes pieces of the enemy in direct left and right of the pawn. |
