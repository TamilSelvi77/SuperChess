# SUPERCHESS
Chess has long stood as a benchmark of logic, strategy, and computational thinking, but most digital implementations remain limited to rigid adherence to tournament rules. While
this preserves the integrity of the game, it can also feel repetitive or unwelcoming for casual players who desire creativity, variability, or a lighter gaming experience.
SuperChess was created to address this gap. It is a Python-based chess application that includes two distinct modes:
1. Normal Mode – A faithful implementation of traditional chess, with all rules applied correctly.
2. Super Mode – An innovative variant where each chess piece is equipped with unique superpowers that can be activated through an energy charge system. By combining the familiar mechanics of chess with novel gameplay features, SuperChess provides a balanced experience for both classic players and those seeking fun and experimentation.
